**Speed Dating project for certification**

The project aims at doing some statistics and visualization. The dataset provides information on some experimental speed dating events.  
In order to understand what makes people interested into each other, I chose to focus on mainly 2 topics :
- Do people perceive themselves accurately and how do the speed dating events affect them ?
- Exploration of a few parameters that can influence matches and dates.
